**comments
-for an inline comment : //in-line comment

**data type & variables
undefined , null ,  boolean, string , symbol, number.....
- variable is like a memory location tat function as a storage in a program
- var myname = "Mohamed" //it can be used thro the wole program
- let myname = "mohamed" //it only can be used were i declare it
- const pi = 3.14 // a variable tat cna never change
/* 
to print out the output 
  console.log(variable);
*/
-one use of string is:
var c  = "i am a";
c = c + " string";
*for operations it'is pretty much like in C
-var d = 1 + 3;
-var f = 1 - 3;
..... and so on for other operations.
as well as for incrementing and decrementing
for strings  liek in tis example :
var string = "i am a " double quotes" string inside " double quotes"";
we can just add / before the quotes
********************************
to know wut type of data we have
console.log(typeof <name of data type>)
equal to :value comparison /value and type 
console.log(4 == '4')
output = true
console.log(4 === '4')
output = false
same as with not equal

 result = num * result 
 num--
